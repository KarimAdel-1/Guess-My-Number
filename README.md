# Guess My Number

## Overview

"Guess My Number" is a simple and fun number-guessing game built with React. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. With each guess, you'll receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game keeps track of your score and high score, and provides visual feedback with background color changes.

- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your current score and high score.
- **Visual Feedback:** Background color changes to green when you guess correctly and red when you lose.
- **Reset Functionality:** Start a new game and reset the score with a single click.
